# Testing Strategy

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline a comprehensive testing strategy for the JobEqual platform. A robust testing strategy is essential for ensuring the quality, reliability, and maintainability of the application as it grows and evolves.

This strategy builds upon the existing foundation of unit tests and the CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs these tests on every change.

## 1. Linting (Recommended Next Step)

A consistent code style and early detection of potential errors are crucial for a healthy codebase. While enhancing the CI/CD pipeline, it was noted that ESLint is not yet set up for this project.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Set up ESLint:** Install ESLint along with a standard, recommended configuration (e.g., `eslint-config-airbnb` or a combination of `eslint:recommended` and `plugin:react/recommended`).
*   **Add a `lint` script:** Add a `lint` script to `package.json` (e.g., `"lint": "eslint ."`).
*   **Integrate with CI/CD:** Add a "Lint" step to the CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to automatically check the code on every push and pull request.

## 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests are essential for verifying that the different parts of the application work together correctly, especially the backend API endpoints.

**Strategy:**

*   **Leverage Existing Tools:** Continue to use `vitest` and `supertest` to write integration tests for the API.
*   **Create a Dedicated Test Suite:** Organize integration tests in a separate directory (e.g., `tests/integration`) to distinguish them from unit tests.
*   **Key Test Scenarios:** Prioritize writing integration tests for the following scenarios:
    *   **Authentication Flow:** A test that simulates a user signing up, signing in, and then accessing a protected API route.
    *   **Core Feature Flows:** Tests that cover the end-to-end flow of the core features, such as:
        *   Creating a new job posting and then fetching it via the API.
        *   Creating a subscription and verifying the user's status.

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests provide the highest level of confidence by simulating real user workflows in a browser.

**Strategy:**

*   **Adopt an E2E Framework:** I recommend using **Playwright** for E2E testing. It's a modern, powerful, and reliable framework that is well-suited for this project. Cypress is also a strong alternative.
*   **Critical User Journeys:** Focus on creating E2E tests for the most critical user journeys:
    *   User registration and login.
    *   Searching for a job, viewing the details, and applying.
    *   The complete subscription workflow, from selecting a plan to being redirected to Stripe.
    *   A basic interaction with the AI chatbot.

## 4. Code Coverage

Measuring code coverage helps to identify untested parts of the codebase.

**Strategy:**

*   **Generate Coverage Reports:** Configure Vitest to generate code coverage reports by adding the `--coverage` flag to the `test` script in `package.json`.
*   **Set a Coverage Target:** Aim for a realistic code coverage target (e.g., 80%) and gradually work towards it. The goal is not just to hit a number, but to ensure that the most critical parts of the application are well-tested.
*   **Review Coverage Reports:** Regularly review the coverage reports to identify areas that need more testing.

By implementing this testing strategy, we can significantly improve the quality and reliability of the JobEqual platform, making it easier and safer to add new features in the future.
