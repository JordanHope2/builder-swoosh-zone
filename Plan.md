JobEqual Full-Stack Project Implementation
Frontend: Next.js with Builder.io Integration
    • Technology & Framework: The frontend is built with Next.js 13 (React) to leverage its hybrid static/server rendering and built-in internationalization. We integrate Builder.io as a headless CMS for a visual drag-and-drop page editing experience. This is done by installing the Builder SDK (@builder.io/react) and initializing it with JobEqual’s Builder.io Public API Key (ea8a771bec0f40debf22ee94a25cce67). For example, in Next.js _app.js (or a dedicated Builder page component), we include:
import { builder, BuilderComponent } from '@builder.io/react';
builder.init('ea8a771bec0f40debf22ee94a25cce67');  // Connect to Builder.io project[1]

// Later in a page render:
// <BuilderComponent model="page" content={pageContent} />
This allows Next.js to fetch page content from Builder and render it. Dynamic catch-all routes (pages/[...page].tsx) are set up to render Builder pages, using getStaticProps/getStaticPaths for incremental static regeneration[1]. Non-technical team members can thus create or edit pages (e.g. landing, FAQs) in Builder’s UI, and those changes appear on the Next.js site without code changes.
    • UI Pages & Components: We implement a comprehensive UI with React and modular components:
    • Job Browsing: A homepage or /jobs page lists available jobs with search and filters (e.g. by location, role, etc.). It might use server-side data fetching (Next.js getServerSideProps) or a client fetch to our API. We also add a swipe-based job discovery component for a Tinder-like UX: one job is shown at a time in a card, and the user can swipe right/left (or tap buttons) to indicate interest. Swiping triggers an animation and then loads the next job. This is implemented with touch event handlers or a library like react-swipeable for smooth mobile swiping. User preferences (like “liked” jobs) are sent to the backend via an API call to record the action.
    • Job Details: Clicking a job opens a detailed page /jobs/[id] with full description, company info, requirements, etc. This page can be statically generated for SEO, with a fallback if new jobs are added.
    • Candidate Profile: A secure page /profile allows candidates to view and edit their information. This includes personal details, uploaded resume (with an option to parse it for filling profile fields), job preferences, and a list of their past applications. The UI provides forms for updating info and uses Next.js API routes or direct API calls to the backend to save changes.
    • Recruiter Interface: Recruiters have their own section (e.g. /recruiter/dashboard). Here they can post new jobs (a form for job title, description, location, etc.), review applications for their postings, and interact with candidates (messaging). We provide a dashboard view with stats (e.g. number of views or applications per job) and a list of jobs they posted. Each job entry links to an applicant list and messaging interface.
    • Dashboard & Navigation: A top-level navigation handles role-based links (candidates vs recruiters see different menu items). A general dashboard could show aggregated analytics (for an admin or for the user’s own activity, e.g. a candidate sees how many jobs viewed/applied, a recruiter sees recent applicant activity). This can be implemented with conditional rendering based on user role.
    • Design & Responsiveness: We use a modern, responsive design with CSS flexbox/grid and possibly a utility framework like Tailwind CSS or a component library (Material-UI, Chakra, etc.) for fast development. All pages are mobile-friendly: the layout adjusts for smaller screens (burger menu for navigation, cards stack vertically, swipe gestures enabled on touch devices). We thoroughly test the swipe feature on mobile to ensure it’s smooth. We also ensure components are accessible (proper ARIA labels, focus states).
    • Multilingual Support: The app supports English, French, German, Italian. We leverage Next.js internationalization routing to serve localized pages. In next.config.js, we define the locales and default locale, for example:
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de', 'it'],
    defaultLocale: 'en',
  }
};
Next.js will automatically handle locale-specific routes (e.g. /fr/profile for French)[2]. We use JSON resource files or a library like next-i18next to manage translation strings for UI text. Builder.io can also manage multilingual content; using locale-specific fields or separate models for each language, content editors can provide translations for any CMS-driven text. The application detects the user’s language (via browser settings or profile preference) and displays the appropriate locale. All static labels (buttons, headings, etc.) are translated, and we ensure RTL support isn’t needed for these specific languages (since all are LTR).
    • State Management & Performance: For client-side data (e.g. the state of swiped jobs or chat messages), we use React state or Context API. More complex state (like global auth info or job lists) can be managed via Context or a lightweight state library. We utilize Next.js dynamic imports and code-splitting to keep initial loads fast, and use image optimization (Next Image component) for company logos or profile pictures. Where possible, pages are pre-rendered; for data that must be fresh (like job search results or chat), we use client-side fetching with SWR or React Query hitting our backend API.
Backend: Node.js, Express & Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    • Tech Stack: The backend is a Node.js server using Express.js for a RESTful API. We use Supabase as our database and auth provider – Supabase is built on PostgreSQL and provides authentication, storage, and realtime out of the box. The Postgres database is hosted by Supabase (fully managed), ensuring scalability and reliability. We connect to it either through Supabase’s JS client (which wraps PostgREST and handles auth) or via a direct Postgres client (node-postgres or an ORM like Prisma). In this case, we use the Supabase client for convenience. We initialize it with the Supabase project URL and the service role API key (for privileged server access) as environment variables:
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseServiceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceKey);
This server-side client allows querying the database and using Supabase Auth functions securely[3].
    • Database Schema: The PostgreSQL schema is designed to handle all core data entities with scalability in mind. Key tables include:
    • Users – stores user accounts. Fields: id (UUID, primary key), email, password_hash (if not using external auth; Supabase handles this in its auth system), role (enum: candidate, recruiter, admin), created_at. Additional profile fields could be in a separate Profiles table or as extended columns here: e.g. full_name, location, bio, resume_url (path to uploaded resume in Supabase Storage).
    • Jobs – job postings. Fields: id (UUID PK), title, description (text), company (text), location (text), employment_type (e.g. full-time, contract), salary_range (text or numeric fields min_salary, max_salary), skills (text array or JSON of required skills/tags), posted_by (foreign key referencing Users table, the recruiter), created_at, status (open/closed). We index posted_by and maybe full-text index on title/description for search.
    • Applications – job applications by candidates. Fields: id (PK), job_id (FK to Jobs), candidate_id (FK to Users), cover_letter (text), resume_text (text of the resume at time of application for historical record, or a link if using file), status (e.g. applied, interview, hired, rejected), applied_at. This tracks each application. A unique constraint on (job_id, candidate_id) prevents duplicate applications.
    • Messages – for the messaging feature between candidates and recruiters (or with AI chatbot, though that might be separate). Fields: id (PK), conversation_id (could be a composite of job and user IDs or a separate table if multi-party chat), sender_id (FK Users), receiver_id (FK Users, or null if message is from system/AI), content (text), timestamp. For candidate-recruiter chat, a conversation could be tied to an application or job. We include an index on conversation or participants for quick retrieval.
    • ActivityLogs – records key user activities for audit and analytics. Fields: id, user_id, action (e.g. 'JOB_LIKED', 'JOB_APPLIED', 'MESSAGE_SENT'), details (JSON or text describing the action, like job ID or message snippet), timestamp. This helps build a user activity timeline or feed and can be useful for analytics (e.g. counting daily signups, job posts, etc.).
    • Preferences – stores user preferences for job matching and notifications. Fields: id, user_id (FK), various preference columns (could be columns like preferred_location, preferred_role or a JSON blob of criteria). This is used to filter jobs for recommendations and to trigger alerts (e.g. if a new job matches a saved search).
    • AI_MatchScores – stores AI-generated matching results (optional but useful to cache expensive AI computations). Fields: id, candidate_id, job_id, score (numeric score or percentage), ai_explanation (text explaining the match). Every time we run the AI matching for a candidate-job pair, we can store the result here for later quick retrieval. We index (candidate_id, score) for retrieving top matches per user. This table could be refreshed periodically as new jobs or profile updates come in.
    • (Optional) Chats – if we implement persistent AI chatbot conversations, we might store chat history: id, user_id, role (candidate or recruiter), message (text), is_from_ai (boolean). However, for simplicity, the AI assistant might not store long conversation history server-side (it can be maintained in memory or on the client during a session).
All tables have foreign key relations defined with ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate (e.g. deleting a user could cascade delete their applications, though often we’d just mark them inactive rather than hard-delete). We enable Row Level Security on tables in Supabase and create policies so that, for example, candidates can only SELECT their own applications or profile (ensuring privacy), recruiters can only see applications to their jobs, etc. This extra layer is in addition to our API-level checks.
    • REST API Endpoints: We design clear RESTful endpoints under /api. Key routes include:
    • POST /api/auth/signup and POST /api/auth/login: For user registration and login if we handle it manually. However, since we use Supabase Auth, we often let the frontend talk directly to Supabase for signup/login (e.g. via Supabase JS signIn()), and the backend mainly verifies tokens. We may still wrap Supabase calls for custom logic (e.g. to create an initial profile or send a welcome email).
    • GET /api/jobs – list jobs with query params for filtering (e.g. ?location=Zurich&search=engineer). Publicly accessible for browsing. Supports pagination.
    • GET /api/jobs/:id – get detailed info on one job. Public.
    • POST /api/jobs – create a new job (recruiter only). The request body contains job fields; we authenticate the user and use their user_id as posted_by. On success, returns the new job ID. We enforce via middleware that only users with role recruiter can access this.
    • PUT /api/jobs/:id – update a job (recruiter only, must be owner of that job). Allows editing description, status, etc.
    • DELETE /api/jobs/:id – delete a job posting (recruiter only or admin).
    • GET /api/jobs/:id/applications – list applications for a specific job (recruiter who posted it only). This allows the recruiter to see candidates who applied.
    • POST /api/jobs/:id/apply – candidate applies to a job. Body may include a cover letter text. The server checks that the user is a candidate and hasn’t applied before, then creates an entry in Applications and maybe triggers a notification (email or in-app) to the recruiter.
    • GET /api/applications – candidate’s view of their own applications (with status). Candidate must be auth’d; we filter by candidate_id = user.id.
    • POST /api/applications/:id/message – send a message regarding an application or job. This could create a new Message entry. Alternatively, we have a more generic messaging endpoint:
    • GET /api/messages?conversationId=X – get messages in a conversation (identified by a job + candidate, or a specific conversation ID).
    • POST /api/messages – send a new message. The body would include target (e.g. job_id and recipient id or conversation id). The server verifies that the sender is either the job poster or the candidate for that job before allowing.
    • GET /api/profile – get current user’s profile (auth required). Merges data from Supabase Auth (like email) and our extended profile info.
    • PUT /api/profile – update profile info. Candidates can update their resume, skills, etc.; recruiters can update company info. We validate and then persist to the Profiles table or Users table accordingly.
    • GET /api/recommendations – get job recommendations for the logged-in candidate. This triggers the AI matching logic (described below) to find top N jobs that fit the user. It may return jobs along with a match score or reason. We might cache results in AI_MatchScores and simply return those if they are recent.
    • POST /api/parse-resume – (AI feature) parse an uploaded resume. The frontend can send a file (or the text extracted from it) to this endpoint. The backend then calls the OpenAI API to extract structured data or summary (details in AI section). The response might be structured JSON (e.g. {education: [...], skills: [...], experience: [...]}) or a summary that the frontend uses to pre-fill profile fields.
    • POST /api/ai-chat – proxy endpoint for AI assistant queries. The client sends a message and perhaps a context (like which assistant: “candidateAssistant” or “recruiterAssistant”). The server will construct a prompt with the user’s context and call OpenAI’s Chat Completion API, then stream or return the assistant’s reply. We do this server-side to keep the OpenAI API key secure and to potentially log the conversation (for moderation or future training).
    • GET /api/dashboard-metrics – (optional) returns data for dashboards, like counts of jobs, applications, matches, etc., possibly with some analysis (which could be computed via SQL or using OpenAI for narrative).
All endpoints enforce authentication where needed. We use Express middleware to check the Supabase JWT on protected routes. Specifically, we extract the Authorization: Bearer <token> header, then call Supabase’s auth API to get the user data from the token[4]. For example:
async function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!authHeader) return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token' });
  const token = authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  const { data: user, error } = await supabase.auth.api.getUser(token);
  if (error || !user) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
  req.user = user;  // attach user info (contains user.id, etc.)
  next();
}
app.use('/api', authMiddleware);  // apply to all /api routes (could refine path)
This uses Supabase’s built-in JWT verification (via getUser)[4] to ensure the token is valid. Protected routes then use req.user. For example, in POST /jobs, we check req.user.role is recruiter and proceed[5]. This way, we rely on Supabase for auth security and avoid managing our own JWT secrets.
    • Realtime Updates: Supabase offers realtime channels on database changes. In the future, we could use this to update the frontend (e.g. a recruiter gets a live update when a new application arrives). For now, our MVP uses simple polling or on-demand fetch for new data, but the architecture allows adding websockets or Supabase’s realtime to push events (with minimal code changes).
    • Scalability & Performance: The database is normalized and indexed to ensure queries perform well (for instance, an index on Applications(candidate_id) and Applications(job_id) for fast lookups). For full-text search on job descriptions, we can use PostgreSQL tsvector columns or Supabase’s PG Full Text Search. The Express server can be stateless (each request independent), which allows horizontal scaling if needed (Railway can run multiple instances if demand grows). Expensive operations (like AI calls or complex queries) are designed to be asynchronous or cached when possible, to keep the API responsive (for example, caching job recommendation results for a user for a short time).
AI Features Integration
The platform includes AI-powered features to enhance user experience, leveraging OpenAI’s API (GPT-4/GPT-3.5 models) for natural language understanding and generation. All AI operations are implemented on the backend (Node/Express) for security and efficiency.
    • Resume Parsing: When a candidate uploads their resume (PDF/DOC), the backend handles parsing and extracting key info. We use a library like pdf-parse to extract raw text from PDFs. Then we send this text to the OpenAI API with a prompt asking to parse it. For instance, we might prompt: “Extract the candidate’s name, contact info, education, work experience (with years), and skills from the resume text below, and output as a JSON object.” OpenAI’s GPT can return structured data or a summary. We can also request a brief professional bio. In code, using the official OpenAI Node.js library, it looks like:
const OpenAI = require('openai'); 
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });
const prompt = "Extract key details (Name, Email, Education, Experience, Skills) from this resume:\n" + resumeText;
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4", 
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
});
const parsedData = completion.choices[0].message.content;
We instruct GPT to format the output in JSON for easy consumption. For example, GPT might reply with: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "education": [ ... ], "experience": [ ... ], "skills": ["Python", "Data Analysis", ...] }. The backend then updates the Profiles table with this info (or returns it to the frontend to let the user confirm/edit it). This dramatically speeds up profile creation. (Note: We also handle errors—if OpenAI fails or returns incomplete data, we catch and respond with an error message.)
In a simpler mode, we could ask GPT just for a summary of the candidate (e.g. a 300-word professional summary). An example from a similar implementation demonstrates calling GPT-3.5 to summarize resume text[6]. The resume parsing feature uses a combination of deterministic parsing (for contact info) and AI (for understanding roles and skills), giving candidates a quick way to build their profile.
    • Job–Candidate Matching (AI Scoring): One of JobEqual’s core features is intelligent matching between job postings and candidate profiles. We implement this in two layers:
    • Rule-based/Vector Pre-filtering: We compute embeddings for job descriptions and candidate resumes/skills using OpenAI’s embeddings (e.g. text-embedding-ada-002). These embeddings (numerical vectors) are stored in the database or a vector store. When a candidate is looking for matches, we quickly compute cosine similarity between the candidate’s profile vector and all job vectors to get a rough ranking. This is efficient for narrowing down the search from thousands of jobs to, say, the top 20 plausible matches.
    • GPT Scoring & Explanation: For the top matches, we use GPT to perform a deeper comparison. We feed the job description and the candidate’s info into a prompt asking for a match score and reasoning. For example: “Here is a job description: [text]. Here is a candidate’s profile: [text]. Evaluate how well the candidate fits this job on a scale of 1 to 10, and give a brief explanation focusing on skills and experience match.” GPT will then respond with something like: “Score: 8/10. The candidate has 5 years of experience in React which matches the job’s requirement of React expertise, and also has project management experience which is a plus. Lacks familiarity with Django mentioned in the job.”. We parse the score and store it.
In this way, each candidate can get a list of jobs with AI-generated match scores and explanations. We surface to the frontend something like a “Recommended Jobs” list sorted by score, including the explanation of “Why this job is recommended for you”. This adds transparency and personalization, much like Indeed’s GPT-based explanations for job matches[7][8]. We cache these results in the AI_MatchScores table with a timestamp. If the user requests recommendations again soon, we serve cached results to avoid calling the API repeatedly. We refresh scores when either the job or the profile significantly changes, or after a time interval.
The matching process uses GPT-4 for the best quality (especially to get a coherent explanation). If needed, we could fine-tune a smaller model or use GPT-3.5 for cost efficiency, but initially the focus is on accuracy of matching. An example workflow from an automation perspective: identify required skills from the job, compare with resume, then produce a compatibility score 1-5[9]. Our approach is similar – GPT analyzes job requirements vs. candidate skills and outputs a score (we use a 1–10 or percentage scale for granularity)[9].
    • AI Assistant Chatbot: We provide an AI chat assistant for both candidates and recruiters, accessible via a chat UI on the platform:
    • Candidate’s Assistant: Helps job seekers with career advice and platform guidance. For example, candidates can ask “How can I improve my resume for data science roles?” or “What does this job’s requirement X mean?” The assistant (powered by GPT) is given a custom system prompt to act as a career coach and JobEqual guide. It might have access to the user’s profile (with permission) to give personalized tips. We implement this by capturing the user’s question in the frontend, sending it to our backend /api/ai-chat endpoint. The backend composes a prompt with a system message like: “You are a helpful career assistant for a job platform. Answer questions informatively and encourage the user.” It may also include relevant data (e.g., the user’s skills or the job they are viewing, if the query is context-specific). Then we call openai.ChatCompletion.create() with model gpt-4 (or gpt-3.5-turbo) and stream the response back to the frontend. We ensure the assistant doesn’t leak any sensitive info and keeps a professional tone. Optionally, we can use OpenAI’s Moderation API to filter any inappropriate user inputs.
    • Recruiter’s Assistant: Tailored to recruiters, this AI helper can answer questions like “How to craft an effective job description for a software engineer?” or “What interview questions should I ask for a data analyst?”. Its system prompt frames it as an HR assistant expert. It could even analyze an incoming resume for the recruiter (“The candidate’s resume emphasizes marketing; this role is technical, so they may not be a strong fit for the engineering role.”) – effectively giving an AI opinion on applicants. This assistant uses the same API but different context.
Both chatbots maintain context of the conversation by sending the recent message history in the API call (within token limits), enabling follow-up questions. We handle the UI such that the conversation appears seamless. Since these are essentially AI opinions, we clearly inform users this is a beta assistant, and actual human judgment is important. The OpenAI API calls and responses are logged server-side for monitoring usage and improving prompts.
    • Smart Recommendations & Predictive Analytics: Beyond direct job matching, we incorporate AI for broader analytics:
    • Job Recommendations: The system not only matches by skills but also learns from user behavior. For example, if a candidate frequently views or swipes “like” on project manager roles, the platform can suggest more of those or related roles. We analyze the ActivityLogs with an AI model: feed a summary of a user’s activity to GPT and ask “What kind of roles is this user interested in? What would you recommend they explore?”. GPT might detect patterns (e.g. lots of frontend developer job views) and suggest relevant opportunities, which we can surface in the UI (like “Because you showed interest in Frontend Developer roles, check out these UI/UX roles too.”).
    • Predictive Hiring Analytics: For recruiters (or platform admin), we can use data to predict outcomes. For instance, using historical data, we can predict how long it might take to fill a job or which candidates are likely to get multiple offers. While rigorous predictive modeling might require traditional ML, we can prototype with GPT by providing some stats and asking for insights. For example, “We have 50 applicants for a role, 5 were interviewed, none hired yet after 30 days” – we prompt GPT to analyze bottlenecks or suggest actions (perhaps “Consider increasing the salary range or expanding required skills”). In the future, this could be replaced or augmented by a custom ML model using our data. For now, these insights could appear on a recruiter’s dashboard as tips.
    • AI-driven Notifications: The platform can notify users intelligently. E.g., “This new job matches 90% of your profile – you might want to apply!” using the match score, or “It’s been a while since you updated your profile; consider adding new skills.” These notifications are generated based on triggers but phrased using GPT for a friendly tone.
All AI features are implemented with careful consideration of privacy and cost: - We do not share personal data with the AI beyond what’s necessary for the task (and users are informed when their resume is being analyzed by AI). - The OpenAI API key is stored securely on the backend, and all calls are made server-side. - We monitor usage to manage API costs (caching results like match scores, limiting the length of resume text sent by summarizing it first, etc.). - These features are modular: if API costs are a concern, we can toggle them or fall back to non-AI functionality (e.g. disable the chatbot, or use simple keyword matching for recommendations).
Hosting and Deployment (Vercel & Railway)
    • Monorepo Structure: The codebase is organized so that frontend and backend are separate but can live in one repository (e.g., a root with /frontend and /backend directories). Each has its own package.json and README. This structure is GitHub-ready, meaning the repository can be connected to deployment platforms easily. We include a root README.md with an overview and then more detailed docs in each subfolder.
    • Frontend on Vercel: The Next.js app is ideal for deployment on Vercel. We ensure there is no server-side secret usage in Next (any secret keys are used via the backend API only or via Supabase’s secure endpoints). In the Vercel dashboard, we set environment variables:
    • NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL – the Supabase project URL for the frontend to make supabase-js calls (for Auth and possibly some data fetching).
    • NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY – the public anon key provided by Supabase (this allows the front-end to call supabase directly for auth and non-privileged DB reads if needed).
    • NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY – the Builder.io public API key (so that the Builder SDK on the client can fetch content if we use client-side rendering for some widgets; however, in our setup Builder content is mostly fetched server-side via getStaticProps).
    • NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL – the base URL of the backend API (if the frontend needs to call it; e.g., in development http://localhost:3001, in production maybe an HTTPS URL or Vercel Serverless Functions domain if we choose to deploy API separately).
    • Also, NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME or other configs as needed (for instance for analytics keys).
We configure rewrites or proxies if needed so that in production the frontend can call the backend. Alternatively, we could deploy the backend on a subdomain and configure CORS accordingly. Vercel will auto-detect the Next.js app and deploy it, performing server-side rendering as needed. Since our Next app uses static generation (with ISR) for builder pages and potentially job pages, Vercel handles the revalidation (as per revalidate settings in getStaticProps).
For multilingual routing on Vercel, Next.js handles locale domains or prefixes automatically. If we wanted domain-specific locales (e.g., jobequal.fr for French), Vercel supports that via domain settings, but likely we use path prefixes (like /fr/*) which require no special config beyond next.config.js.
We also include a vercel.json if necessary to set up headers or redirects, but it’s not strictly required. Deployment is as simple as pushing to the main branch – Vercel will build the Next app (running npm run build which runs static generation and compiles the app) and then host it globally.
    • Backend on Railway: The Express server is containerized for deployment on Railway. We add a Dockerfile in the backend directory to define how to run the Node app (from a Node 18 base image, install deps, copy code, expose port 3001). Railway can auto-detect and build from this. We also provide a Railway Procfile or set the start command (npm run start) so Railway knows how to start the server. Key environment variables to set on Railway (in the project settings) include:
    • SUPABASE_URL – URL of the Supabase instance (e.g. https://XYZ.supabase.co).
    • SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY – the secret service role API key from Supabase (with this, our server can bypass RLS if needed and perform admin tasks; this key is kept secret and never exposed to frontend).
    • OPENAI_API_KEY – the secret key for OpenAI API.
    • JWT_SECRET (optional) – if we wanted to verify Supabase JWT manually, we could use the JWT secret from Supabase config. However, using Supabase client’s getUser is easier as shown above.
    • NODE_ENV – set to "production" on Railway to enable production optimizations.
    • Any other third-party API keys or config (e.g. if using an email service, etc.).
Railway will provide us a public URL for the deployed API (something like https://<app-name>.up.railway.app). We use that as the base URL for API calls from the frontend (set in the Vercel env as mentioned). We also configure CORS in the Express app to allow the Vercel frontend’s domain. For example, using the cors middleware:
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors({ origin: ['https://jobequal.com', 'https://<my-vercel>.vercel.app'] }));
This ensures browser requests from our front-end are accepted. In development, we use origin: http://localhost:3000 similarly.
Railway deployment is seamless after setup: when we push code to GitHub, Railway can auto-deploy the backend. We have separate GitHub workflows or manual triggers as needed. We also set up Railway’s health check pings if desired (to keep the container warm, though Railway can handle traffic scaling automatically).
    • Supabase Setup: We treat Supabase as an external resource:
    • The Postgres database is created when we set up the Supabase project. We run our migrations or SQL scripts to create the tables. These could be applied via Supabase SQL editor or via a migration tool. We include an SQL schema file (e.g. schema.sql) in the repo for reference, which contains CREATE TABLE statements for all tables and CREATE POLICY statements for RLS rules.
    • Auth: In Supabase Auth settings, we enable email/password login (and social providers if needed). We configure email templates for confirmation/reset emails with the JobEqual branding.
    • We might also set up a Storage bucket in Supabase (for resumes and profile images), giving public read access to certain folders (or using signed URLs).
    • Supabase’s URL and keys are provided as mentioned to the app. We never commit actual keys in the code – .env files are used for local dev, and example env templates (.env.example) are provided for reference.
    • Environment Variable Management: We supply .env.example files for both frontend and backend with placeholders for all keys needed. For instance:
    • In /frontend/.env.example:
    • NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY=ea8a771bec0f40debf22ee94a25cce67
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001    (for dev, change in prod)
    • In /backend/.env.example:
    • SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...yourOpenAIKey...
JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET (if using direct JWT verification)
    • We include instructions in the README to rename these to .env and fill in real values.
    • GitHub & CI/CD: The repository can be connected to both Vercel and Railway for continuous deployment. Additionally, we set up a simple GitHub Actions workflow that runs on pull requests or merges: it can run npm run build && npm run lint for both frontend and backend to ensure code builds successfully (and perhaps run tests if added). This acts as a quality gate. After merges to main, the deployments kick in on Vercel/Railway.
    • Domain and HTTPS: When ready, we map a custom domain (e.g. jobequal.com) to the Vercel frontend. The backend Railway app can either be behind an API subdomain (e.g. api.jobequal.com) with appropriate CNAME, or since the frontend and backend are separate domains we’ll just consume the Railway domain from the frontend. All communication is over HTTPS. We ensure secure cookies and localStorage usage for any tokens if applicable.
In summary, the deployment setup ensures that the frontend (Next.js) is optimally hosted on a CDN edge network (via Vercel), and the backend (Express) runs in a scalable container environment (via Railway), both configured through environment variables and ready for a production environment.
Security and DevOps Best Practices
    • Supabase Authentication & Row-Level Security: We rely on Supabase’s secure auth system, which issues JWTs for clients. Each JWT includes the user’s UUID and role claims. We set up Row-Level Security (RLS) on tables with policies that reference the Supabase Auth user. For example, on the Jobs table we might allow select to all (jobs are public), but on Applications we write policies: Recruiter can select applications if job.posted_by = auth.uid(); Candidate can select if applications.candidate_id = auth.uid(). This means even if someone tried to query the database outside our API, the rules enforce data isolation[4]. Our Express middleware also checks roles as described, adding another layer. We do input validation on all API payloads (using a library like Joi or express-validator) to prevent bad data or attempted SQL injection (though using the Supabase client or parameterized queries means SQL injection is not a concern).
    • Environment-based Configuration: The app reads config from environment variables, which allows us to maintain separate configs for development, testing, and production. No secrets or environment-specific constants are hardcoded. For instance, we use process.env.NODE_ENV to determine if we’re in dev or prod and adjust logging verbosity. We keep separate .env files for local dev (not checked into git) and use platform settings for prod. This also means we can safely open-source portions of the code (like frontend) without exposing keys (since the real keys are injected in deployment).
    • Secure Secrets Handling: API keys for third-party services (OpenAI, etc.) are only present on the server. The frontend only uses public keys (Supabase anon, which is safe by design, and the Builder public API key). We instruct developers to never commit secrets. The .gitignore includes .env files. In documentation, we outline how to obtain necessary keys (OpenAI API key from OpenAI account, Supabase keys from its dashboard, etc.).
    • HTTPS and Secure Cookies: The production deployment uses HTTPS everywhere (enforced by Vercel and Railway by default). If we use cookies for anything (e.g., if we allow SSR rendering of some pages that need auth, we might store the Supabase token in a HttpOnly cookie), we mark them Secure and SameSite. However, since our Next.js app is mostly client-side auth (Supabase JS keeps the token in local storage by default), we mostly rely on the bearer token header approach. We ensure CORS is correctly configured to only allow our domain, preventing other origins from abusing our API with user tokens.
    • Content Security Policy (CSP): We can add a CSP via meta tags or headers to restrict allowed domains for scripts, frames, etc., especially since we integrate a third-party (Builder.io). We trust Builder’s script for editing (only used in preview mode), but ensure no other untrusted scripts run.
    • Code Organization and Quality: The project follows a clean architecture approach:
    • In the backend, we separate concerns into folders like routes/ (Express route definitions), controllers/ (functions handling requests), services/ (business logic, e.g. AI service module for OpenAI calls, a database module for constructing queries), and models/ (if using an ORM or for Typescript types). This makes the codebase scalable as features grow. For example, an ai.service.js encapsulates all OpenAI interactions (with functions like parseResume(text), scoreMatch(job, profile)), while a jobs.controller.js handles HTTP req/res, calling services and returning JSON.
    • In the frontend, we use a feature-based structure: components are grouped (e.g. a components/chat/ folder for chatbot-related components, components/jobs/ for job cards, etc.). We utilize Next.js pages directory (or App directory if we choose), and possibly a custom _document and _app for global stuff (like loading a CSS framework or setting up a Context Provider for auth).
    • We use TypeScript on both frontend and backend for type safety (this helps catch errors early and defines clear interfaces, e.g. a TypeScript interface for a Job object or for the AI response JSON). The Next.js app is created with --typescript. The Express app can also be in TypeScript (with a build step) or plain JS if preferred, but TypeScript is recommended for reliability.
    • Code style is enforced with ESLint (Next comes with a default ESLint config) and formatted with Prettier. We include configs for these and maybe a pre-commit hook (using Husky) to lint before commit, keeping the code style consistent.
    • DevOps and Monitoring: We set up basic monitoring/logging:
    • The backend logs requests and errors. We use a middleware like morgan for HTTP logs. Critical errors are caught and logged (console or a file). For production, we consider integrating a service like Sentry for error tracking on both frontend and backend, so we get alerted of exceptions.
    • We implement some tests for critical pieces: e.g., a Jest test for the function that calculates similarity or for the API endpoint that creates an application (using a mock DB). This ensures core logic works as expected and helps prevent regressions. In a full project, we’d expand tests, but for this implementation we prioritize integration tests for major flows if time permits.
    • Using GitHub Actions, as mentioned, we run tests and linter on every push. This CI helps maintain code quality. We also consider using Renovate or Dependabot to keep dependencies up to date given the project will rely on many packages (Next, Supabase, etc.).
    • Scalability: Our architecture ensures that scaling out is straightforward. For example, if traffic increases, we can increase the Railway service plan (more CPU/RAM) or add more instances. The stateless nature of the API means we can load balance without sticky sessions (any state like user sessions is in the JWT or database). The database (Supabase) can be scaled vertically (more resources, read replicas) as needed – Supabase can handle quite large workloads and we can enable its Performance tier if necessary. We also optimize queries and use caching for expensive operations (for instance, the AI matching results as noted, or even HTTP response caching for public GET /jobs with CDN if needed).
    • Security Testing: We review the app for common vulnerabilities. For instance, ensure that file uploads (resumes) are sanitized (we only accept certain file types and scan the content via pdf-parse, which we trust to ignore malicious PDF scripts). We also ensure rate limiting on certain API endpoints to prevent abuse – e.g., the POST /api/ai-chat could be abused to spam our OpenAI usage, so we might use an in-memory rate limiter per IP or user (like “max 5 chat queries per minute” for free users). This could be implemented via an Express middleware or using Supabase’s rate-limiting (Supabase Edge Functions could impose limits if we went that route).
    • Modern Development Workflow: We encourage using tools like VSCode with recommended extensions (we include a .vscode/settings.json recommending ESLint, Prettier, etc.). We also containerize the development environment using Docker Compose (optional): e.g., a compose file that brings up the backend, a Postgres (if not using remote Supabase for dev), and maybe a stub for any external service. This makes onboarding new developers easier – they can run docker-compose up to get a local instance of the whole stack. However, since Supabase is remote, we often just connect to that in dev or run Supabase locally via the Supabase CLI (which provides a local Postgres + auth emulator).
In summary, we follow best practices for security (auth, validation, HTTPS), maintain clean code structure, and have a CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early. The application is built to be maintainable and secure by design, with the ability to grow (new features, more users) without major refactoring.
Automation with n8n (Optional Enhancements)
To further streamline operations, we integrate n8n (a workflow automation tool) for certain background tasks and integrations. These automations are optional and run separately from our main app, but they greatly enhance the system’s capabilities with minimal coding:
    • Job Ingestion Workflow: We set up an n8n workflow to ingest jobs from external sources. For example, suppose we want to populate our platform with jobs from a partner API or an RSS feed (such as Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs RSS, or a custom feed). In n8n, we create a scheduled trigger (runs daily or hourly) that performs the following:
    • Fetch Jobs: Use n8n’s HTTP Request node to call an external jobs API or retrieve an RSS feed of new job postings.
    • Filter/Format Data: Process the results with Function nodes. Filter out jobs that don’t meet certain criteria or that already exist in our DB (we might keep a record of imported job IDs). Convert the data fields from the source into our format (title, description, etc.).
    • Insert into Database: We use either the Supabase node (if available) or direct HTTP POST to our backend API to add the new jobs. For example, n8n could hit POST /api/jobs with the job data and an admin API key for authentication. Alternatively, n8n could connect directly to the Postgres with credentials to insert (though using the API is simpler and respects our validation).
    • Logging: The workflow can log how many jobs were added, and send a notification on success or error (e.g., via email or Slack).
This automation allows JobEqual to continuously aggregate jobs without manual input, keeping the listings fresh. A real-world example is an automation that “scrapes RSS feeds of job sites, filters by date/title, updates a database, then sends to a 'Job Matching Agent' for scoring”[10]. We implement a similar flow: fetch jobs -> update our DB -> optionally trigger our AI match routine for new jobs (so that candidates get immediate match scores).
    • Alerts & Notifications Workflow: Another n8n workflow is set to handle user notifications and other periodic tasks:
    • New Match Alerts: Suppose a candidate saved a job search preference (like “Marketing jobs in Zurich”). We can have a daily trigger in n8n that queries our database (using the Supabase node or an HTTP GET to a dedicated endpoint) for new jobs that match each user’s preferences added in the last 24 hours. For each match, the workflow sends an email to the user with a summary of new jobs. For emailing, n8n can use an SMTP node or integrate with services like SendGrid. The email content can even be AI-generated: e.g., use an OpenAI node to craft a friendly message listing the top 3 new jobs and why they might fit, then send it. This gives users a “Jobs in your inbox” service automatically[10].
    • Application Status Updates: We could automate emails to candidates when their application status changes (if recruiters update an application to “interview” or “hired” in our system, we fire a webhook that n8n catches, which then sends an email notification to the candidate congratulating or informing them).
    • Recruiter Digests: A weekly summary email to recruiters about their jobs – e.g., “You had 120 views and 5 new applications for your job Sales Manager this week.” n8n can gather these stats via our API and compile an email.
    • AI Monitoring: We can use n8n to monitor the OpenAI API usage. For instance, a scheduled job could hit OpenAI’s usage endpoint or parse our logs to see how many tokens were used this week, then alert us or adjust settings (like if usage is nearing a quota, send an alert to admins).
    • Integration with Internal Tools: If JobEqual needs to interface with internal CRM or analytics, n8n can be the glue. For example, when a new user signs up, we can have a webhook (via Supabase function or our backend) that triggers n8n to add that user to a CRM (like HubSpot) or a mailing list. Or if a job post is about to expire (30 days old), n8n can trigger a renewal email to the recruiter automatically.
    • Using n8n: We host n8n either on our infrastructure or use n8n cloud. The workflows are saved (we include JSON export of important workflows in the repo’s automation/ folder for reference). For example, we provide job_ingestion_workflow.json and alerts_workflow.json. These can be imported into n8n. Each workflow uses nodes such as:
    • Cron (for scheduled triggers),
    • Webhook (to start on events from our app; e.g., our backend can call an n8n webhook URL when a new application is created, passing the details),
    • Supabase (n8n has native integration to upsert/select data), or Postgres nodes,
    • HTTP Request (to call our API or third-party APIs),
    • Gmail/SMTP (to send emails to users),
    • Function (to run custom JavaScript for data shaping),
    • OpenAI (there’s an OpenAI node which could be used similarly to how we use it in code, for any AI steps in automation).
These workflows act like cron jobs or event-driven scripts that extend our platform without having to hard-code every feature. They run separately, so even if n8n is down, our core app is unaffected (worst case, some emails or auto-imports are delayed). This decoupling follows the microservice philosophy for non-critical tasks.
    • Example: The Reddit user LilFingaz shared a setup: RSS -> filter -> Sheets DB -> AI matching agent -> email top 3 matches[10]. For JobEqual, our approach would be: Database -> AI matching -> email, since we have our own DB. We could replicate that entire pipeline: daily, for each active candidate, find top 3 matches by AI (we can even call our own /recommendations endpoint), then email those with match percentages and a note. This keeps users engaged with the platform.
    • DevOps for n8n: We treat n8n as an internal tool. If self-hosted, we deploy it via Docker (maybe even on Railway or a separate server) and secure it (with basic auth or restricting to our VPN, since it can execute powerful flows). We store credentials (API keys, SMTP passwords) in n8n’s credentials manager. Each workflow is tested to not spam or duplicate actions. We also ensure any AI usage in n8n (like generating email text) is done with prompts that ensure no sensitive data is exposed inadvertently.
Overall, n8n adds a layer of automation that can handle background processes and integrations without bloating our core codebase. It empowers non-engineers to tweak workflows and helps us react quickly to new requirements (e.g., integrate a new job source, or set up a custom notification) with a low-code approach.

Setup Prerequisites: - Node.js 18+ installed locally. - A Supabase account/project created (free tier is fine to start). - An OpenAI API key. - (Optionally) A Builder.io account with the provided project already set up (Project ID ea8a771bec0f40debf22ee94a25cce67 should correspond to our space – ensure you have access or adjust in code). - (Optionally) n8n instance if you want to use the automations.
1. Cloning the Repository:
Clone the repo from GitHub and cd into the project directory. You will see the two main subfolders as above.
2. Setting Environment Variables:
Create a copy of the provided example env files: - For the frontend:

cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
Open frontend/.env.local and fill in the values for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL (from your Supabase settings page, e.g. https://xyzcompany.supabase.co), NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (from Supabase API settings, anon public key), and ensure the Builder key is present (ea8a771...cce67). Also set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL; during local development, if you run the backend on http://localhost:3001, use that. In production, this would be your Railway URL or custom domain for API. - For the backend:

cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
Edit backend/.env to add SUPABASE_URL (same as above), SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (the service role key from Supabase – keep this secret), OPENAI_API_KEY (your OpenAI key), and if provided, the JWT_SECRET (found in Supabase Settings -> API, this is used by Supabase to sign JWTs – not strictly needed unless you want to manually verify JWTs). You can also set other optional configs like email SMTP creds if we had any.
3. Installing Dependencies:
- Frontend:

cd frontend
npm install
(This will install Next.js, React, Builder.io SDK, i18n libraries, etc.) - Backend:

cd backend
npm install
(Installs Express, supabase-js, OpenAI, multer, pdf-parse, etc. as defined in package.json.)
4. Database Setup:
In Supabase, navigate to the SQL editor and run the SQL commands from backend/database/schema.sql (if provided) or create tables using Supabase's Table editor UI. At minimum, create the tables: users, profiles, jobs, applications, messages, activity_logs, preferences, ai_match_scores with the fields as described in the schema section above. If using Supabase Auth, the users table may be managed by Supabase (the Auth users are in auth.users table internally). In that case, you create a profiles table with user_id as a UUID reference to auth.users. (Our code can accommodate either approach; ensure to adjust queries if needed – e.g., join auth user info with profile info.)
Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for each table. For example, on profiles table: enable RLS and add policy: USING ( user_id = auth.uid() ) for select/update, so users can only see their profile. Supabase documentation has step-by-step instructions for this[4].
5. Running the Backend (Development):
Make sure you’re in backend/ and run:
npm run dev
This starts the Express server on port 3001 (or specified PORT env). The console will log “Server is running on port 3001”[11] if successful. The dev script might use nodemon for auto-reloading on code changes.
Test the backend quickly: using a tool like curl or Postman, try hitting http://localhost:3001/api/health (we often include a simple health endpoint) or the http://localhost:3001/api/jobs (if you seeded some jobs in the DB) to see if it returns data. Since initially no jobs and some endpoints require auth, you might create a test user in Supabase or disable auth checks temporarily to seed data.
6. Running the Frontend (Development):
Open a new terminal and do:
cd frontend/
npm run dev
This launches Next.js on http://localhost:3000. You should see the homepage. Since it’s connected to the backend: - The job list might be empty if no jobs in DB – you can create some via the database or a quick API call. - Test the Builder.io integration: If you configured Builder correctly, you can create a page in Builder (model type "page") with URL "/hello" for instance, publish it, then navigate to http://localhost:3000/hello. Next.js should fetch from Builder and display the content. (You might need to npm run build once or ensure getStaticPaths didn’t exclude it. In development with fallback: true, it should work.) - Test multilingual: go to http://localhost:3000/fr/ and see the French version (you’ll need to provide some translations in the i18n files for it to actually show different text).
Authentication: You can use the Supabase JS client integrated in the frontend. For example, on the sign-up page (maybe at /signup route), we call supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password }). Supabase will send confirmation email if that setting is on. For dev/testing, you can disable email confirmation in Supabase to allow immediate login. On login, Supabase returns a session with a JWT – our frontend should then store it (supabase-js does this and will attach it to future requests via the client). Our API calls from frontend should include this JWT in the Authorization header. Important: The Supabase JS client will do that automatically if we call supabase.from('...').select() etc., but since we use our own Express API, we do:
const token = (await supabase.auth.getSession()).data.session.access_token;
fetch('/api/recommendations', { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } });
We abstract this in a helper so every request attaches the token.
7. AI Features Testing:
- Resume parse: Go to profile page, try uploading a PDF resume. The frontend should send it via the /api/parse-resume endpoint. The backend will log some info (and possibly the OpenAI usage). Check the terminal for logs like “OpenAI completion choice…” etc.[6]. If success, the profile fields should populate. If there’s an error (e.g., missing OpenAI key or too large file), you’ll get an error message. - Recommendations: If you have some jobs and a user with profile, try hitting the "Recommended jobs" section – it will call our /api/recommendations. First run might be slow as GPT is scoring, but then you should see scored job results. This is easier to test by checking the backend logs or database: after calling, see if ai_match_scores table got entries. - Chatbot: Open the chat widget, ask a question. The request goes to /api/ai-chat and you should see a streamed or full response. Verify in the Network tab or console that you got a 200 and some response. The first call might be slow (GPT-4), but subsequent ones should maintain context if we coded it to send conversation history.
8. Deployment: - Backend to Railway: Commit your code to GitHub. On Railway, create a new project from your repository, selecting the backend/ directory for deployment. In Railway settings, add the env vars as mentioned (SUPABASE_URL, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.). Also set the root directory or context to backend if needed so it finds the Dockerfile. Deploy – it should build the Docker image and start. Once running, note the public URL Railway gives (e.g. https://jobequal-api.up.railway.app). Test that URL + /api/health. If you want to use a custom domain for the API, Railway allows that (you could use api.jobequal.com with appropriate DNS). - Frontend to Vercel: In Vercel, add a new project from the GitHub repo, pointing to the frontend/ folder. Set environment vars in Vercel (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, etc., they should be the production values now – e.g., Supabase URL and anon key, the Builder key same, and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL should point to the Railway URL or custom API domain). Build and deploy. Once Vercel gives a URL (or you set your domain), you should be able to visit the site and everything works. Test signup/login flow on production (it will talk to the real Supabase – ensure the Supabase redirect URL is set to your domain if using magic links).
    • Post-Deployment Checklist:
    • Ensure email auth (if using) works in production (set up SMTP settings in Supabase for password recovery, etc.).
    • Enable monitoring: e.g., check Railway logs for errors, and Vercel logs.
    • Set up proper SEO for jobs: We might add meta tags on job pages using Next’s Head component. This could include the job title, meta description, and maybe structured data (JobPosting schema) for Google. This can be done dynamically in getStaticProps.
    • Make sure the Builder preview URL is updated to the production domain (so Builder content editing works on live site)[12].
    • Run through a sample hiring flow: create a recruiter account, post a job, create a candidate account, apply to the job, message from recruiter to candidate – confirm all pieces (emails, messages) go through.
9. Documentation:
We provide documentation for end-users (how to use JobEqual’s features) separately, but the technical documentation is mainly: - The main README for devs (covering much of what’s here: how to set up, how the architecture is designed). - Inline code documentation/comments especially in complex functions (like AI prompt construction). - A postman collection or httpie examples for all API endpoints for testing. - ERD diagram of the database schema for reference (maybe in docs/architecture.md). - Developer guidelines for contributing (code style, branching strategy) if this is a team project.
10. n8n Automation Setup (if using): - Deploy n8n (could even run it locally or on Docker). Import the provided JSON workflows. - Update credentials in those workflows: Supabase or HTTP credentials to call the API (we might create a special API key or use the service role key in a restricted endpoint for these automations). - Activate the workflows. For example, the “Daily Job Alert” workflow should be activated to run at a schedule. The “Job Ingest” workflow should be activated either on schedule or manually triggered. - Test them: e.g., manually run the job import and see jobs appear in DB. Manually trigger an alert for a test user by creating a fake event or adjusting the schedule to run in a minute.
With everything set up, you have a fully functional application: - A candidate can sign up (via Supabase Auth), complete their AI-assisted profile, browse and swipe through jobs (with instant AI match feedback), chat with an AI assistant for career help, and apply to jobs with one click. - A recruiter can post jobs easily, rely on AI to triage candidates (coming soon as we gather data), and chat with an assistant for hiring tips. - The system automatically keeps content fresh (importing jobs) and users engaged (email alerts and AI personalization).
By combining Next.js for a snappy UI, Express/Supabase for a robust backend, and OpenAI for intelligence, JobEqual is built as a modern, scalable solution for job matching[7][9]. All code is included in the attached ZIP (organized as described), along with this documentation and comments to guide you through any further setup. Enjoy your fully-featured JobEqual platform!
