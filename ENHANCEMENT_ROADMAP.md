# Enhancement Roadmap Proposal

## Introduction

This document outlines a proposed roadmap for improving and completing the JobEqual platform. The initial analysis of the codebase has revealed a solid foundation with good security practices. However, there are also several areas for improvement, as well as key features that have been designed on the frontend but not yet implemented on the backend.

This roadmap is intended to provide a clear, prioritized path for future development work.

## 1. Foundational Improvements (Completed)

The following foundational improvements have already been completed to enhance the project's stability and maintainability:

*   **Dependency Audit:** All project dependencies have been updated to their latest non-breaking versions, ensuring that the project is using the most recent and secure libraries.
*   **Configuration Cleanup:** The `vercel.json` file has been removed to align with the project's documentation, which specifies Netlify as the preferred deployment provider. This eliminates confusion and streamlines the deployment configuration.

## 2. Immediate Next Steps (Recommended)

The following are high-priority tasks that should be addressed next:

*   **Remove Unused `JWT_SECRET`:** The `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is defined in `.env.example` but is not used anywhere in the application. It should be removed to avoid confusion and reduce configuration clutter.
*   **Migrate from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to `@supabase/ssr`:** The `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package is deprecated and should be replaced with the new recommended package, `@supabase/ssr`. This is a critical update to ensure the long-term stability and security of the authentication layer.

## 3. Feature Implementation (High Priority)

The following key features are designed on the frontend but require backend implementation:

*   **Implement Stripe Integration:** The subscription and billing UI is fully built out with mock data, but the backend logic to handle payments is missing. The following API endpoints and webhooks need to be created:
    *   An endpoint to create and manage customer subscriptions.
    *   An endpoint to process payments with Stripe.
    *   A webhook handler to listen for and process events from Stripe (e.g., successful payments, failed payments, subscription cancellations).
*   **Implement OpenAI Integration:** The AI chatbot currently uses placeholder logic. An API endpoint needs to be created to connect to the OpenAI API. This will enable the chatbot to provide real, AI-powered responses to user queries.

## 4. CI/CD and Testing (Medium Priority)

To improve the project's reliability and development workflow, the following CI/CD and testing enhancements are recommended:

*   **Enhance GitHub Actions:** The existing CI/CD pipeline should be reviewed and enhanced. It should include steps for:
    *   Running the test suite automatically on every push and pull request.
    *   Linting the codebase to enforce a consistent style.
    *   Building the project to catch any build errors early.
*   **Expand Test Coverage:** The project currently has a small number of unit tests. The test suite should be expanded to include:
    *   Integration tests for all API endpoints.
    *   End-to-end (E2E) tests for critical user flows, such as user registration, job application, and subscription management. A framework like Cypress or Playwright is recommended for E2E testing.

## 5. Monitoring and Observability (Medium Priority)

To ensure the application's health and performance, the following monitoring tools should be configured:

*   **Configure Sentry:** The `README.md` mentions Sentry, but it is not fully integrated. The Sentry SDK should be added to both the frontend and backend to enable real-time error tracking and reporting.
*   **Add Performance Monitoring:** A performance monitoring tool, such as Sentry Performance or the built-in analytics from Netlify, should be configured. This will help to identify and address performance bottlenecks in the application.

## 6. Scalability and Cost Optimization (Low Priority)

As the platform grows, the following areas should be considered:

*   **Database Optimization:** The Supabase database schema and queries should be periodically reviewed to ensure they are optimized for performance and scalability.
*   **Cost Analysis:** The costs of the various services used (Supabase, Netlify, Stripe, OpenAI) should be regularly reviewed to identify any opportunities for optimization.
